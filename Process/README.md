This build Implements the instantiation of GameObjects along with the string method.
We are using cartoon drawings of numbers found on [Freepik](https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/cartoon-number-collection-with-characters_2310808.html).
Adding a little wiggling of the numbers makes them feel surprisingly life-like and fun. The squashing of these things is going to be hilarious.
Next we will add in some placeholder sounds of the numbers saying their names ("eight, eight, eight" etc), and begin working on the rock interaction of the second screen.

Began working on the top part of the interaction. Math problems are being loaded in to the proper window and sized (semi) correctly.
User can input an answer to the problem and hit enter to check to see if it is correct. Program accurately checks this. 
Right now this is happening with strings, but we're going to have to figure out how to display the numbers as sprites instead, since we want those awesome anthropomorphic numbers to get violently squashed.

It's the dawn of a new Whaaat!? Lab  project for the Whaaat!? Festival. A large multiplayer Whaaat!? coin mining operation. Let's do this!
